 <p> Welcome to the Esports at OSU!

As of right now, the Overwatch community is heavily represented in this club compared to other Esports. 
By our official registration with OSU in Winter 2019, we hope to see a growing representation of other Esports titles.
If you are interested in competing in any competitive Esports, please contact us on our <a href="https://discord.gg/cav8WXs>Discord </a>. People looking to be in the club should be passionate
about the competitive nature of Esports and should be willing to work with others to create teams that show how passionate the students at
OSU are about competition in video games. 

If you are a current  student, or will be attending OSU next year, please fill out this google form to allow us to know a 
little bit more about you. https://goo.gl/forms/30hB5fHz3VXOqtyB2
